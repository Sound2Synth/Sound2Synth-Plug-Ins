Dexed - FM Plugin Synth
=======================

**NOTICE: This repo is NOT the original Dexed plug-in. This version of Dexed is modified for using the Sound2Synth plug-in. Functions for matching sound presets are added. All modifications made in the code are labeled with comments** `// Modified from Dexed`**, as required by the GNU General Public License v3.0 License.**

**An off-the-shelf version of the modified plug-in is available under the** `Plug-In/` **folder. VST3 extension is supported. To install it on your macOS computer:**

**1. Place the** `Dexed.vst3` **file under path** `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/VST3/`**.**

**2. Place the** `Dexed.component` **file under path** `/Library/Audio/Plug-Ins/Components/`**.**

**You may need to modify your MacOS's "security and privacy" preferences to run the plug-in in any DAW that supports VST3.**

**If an original Dexed plug-in instance is previously installed on the computer, it would be replaced by this plug-in. So make sure you have saved your original Dexed plug-in before installing this one.**

**The following contents are README from the original Dexed plug-in.**

Please see [Dexed User Website](https://asb2m10.github.io/dexed) for user and download information.

Dexed is a multi platform, multi format plugin synth that is closely modeled on the Yamaha DX7. 
Under the hood it uses [music-synthesizer-for-android](https://github.com/google/music-synthesizer-for-android) 
for the synth engine and [JUCE](https://www.juce.com) as an application/plugin wrapper.

The goal of this project is to be a tool/companion for the original DX7. Sound engine 
with 'float' value parameters, different waveform Ã  la TX81z would be great but anything that 
goes beyond the DX7 should and will be a fork of this project. This is to keep the compatibility with
the original machine.

Dexed is licensed on the GPL v3. The msfa component (acronym for music synthesizer for android, see msfa 
in the source folder) stays on the Apache 2.0 license to able to collaborate between projects.

# How to build DEXED

You will notice that DEXED no longer ships with built makefiles. Rather it has a collection of scripts to 
get a version of JUCE and build them for you. With juce6 this will change even more, but for now to build you
will want to get and run juce and the projucer yourself. Luckily this is fairly easy

## All OSes

DEXED has several submodules it now depends on, including VST3 and a library to support non standard tuning.
After you clone your first step is

```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

which will expand the submodules. Then follow platform specific directions below

## macOS

```
./scripts/get-juce.sh
./scripts/projuce.sh
./scripts/build-mac.sh
```

This will build a VST3, and AU and a Standalone in Build/MacOSX/Release for your

## windows
Run this in the bash shell that comes with the standard Git distribution.

```
./scripts/get-juce.sh
./scripts/projuce.sh
```

then open and build the resulting Visual Studio Solution file.

## Linux

```
./scripts/get-juce.sh
./scripts/projuce.sh
./scripts/build-lin.sh
```

If you get missing header compilation errors, be sure to check the [known Linux dependencies](https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed/wiki/Linux-builds-dependencies) based on your distribution.

### VST2 Support
Since Steinberg has discontinued the VST2 API we no longer distribute a VST2. If you are a licensee to the VST2SDK, though, you can still build it. 

The first thing is to be sure to initialise the path of the VST2 sdk before calling any script builds.

```
export VST2SDK_DIR=~/path/to/vst2/sdk/dir
```
