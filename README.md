# Sound2Synth Plug-Ins

This is the plug-in repo for the [Sound2Synth](https://github.com/Sound2Synth/Sound2Synth/) project, which aims at helping estimate synthesizer parameters given the desired sound textures. The Sound2Synth plug-ins are still under development.

<br/>

## Included Plug-Ins

Currently we support Sound2Synth on `Dexed` only, modified from the original [Dexed](https://github.com/asb2m10/dexed) synthesizer.
